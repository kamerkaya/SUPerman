Related counting problems are also considered. The reductions used are characterized by their nontrivial use of arithmetic."

abstract = "The permanent of matrices has wide applications in many fields of science and engineering. It is, however, a #P-complete problem in counting. The best-known algorithm for computing the permanent, which is due to Ryser [Combinatorial Mathematics, The Carus Mathematical Monographs, vol. 14, Mathematical Association of America, Washington, DC, 1963], runs O(n2n−1) in time. It is possible to speed up algorithms for matrices with special structures, which arise commonly in applications. Most algorithms discussed before focus on 0,1 matrix. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is proposed. It is efficient for sparse matrices."

abstract="DNA profiling is essential for individual identification. In forensic medicine, the likelihood ratio (LR) is commonly used to identify individuals. The LR is calculated by comparing two hypotheses for the sample DNA: that the sample DNA is identical or related to a reference DNA, and that it is randomly sampled from a population. For multiple-fatality cases, however, identification should be considered as an assignment problem, and a particular sample and reference pair should therefore be compared with other possibilities conditional on the entire dataset.",

An efficient deterministic algorithm is presented that allows for the approximate calculation of permanents obtained from sparse positive matrices within controllable precision bounds. The upper and lower bounds can be made arbitrarily close to each other and the algorithm outperforms existing ones for sufficiently large matrices."
